-   [React](https://reactjs.org/).
-   [Calcite Components](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/) via [Calcite Components React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@esri/calcite-components-react) for a component library
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling
-   [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) for multi language support

## Get Started

**Step 1** - Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For additional information, see the [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) Guide topic in the SDK.

**Step 2** - configure Font Awesome Licence.

Review the Global and Per-Project sections within the [Use Package Managers](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/setup/use-package-managers) Guide.

It's important to follow you're organizations best practices for secure secret storage. It's likely you do not want to store your font awesome token within your repository without secrect using a secret manager.
